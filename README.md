# Shopify Webhook
This is a small Django app that listens for incoming webhooks, and then translates those into calls against the Open edX REST APIs.

It provides the following endpoints:

* `webhooks/shopify/order/create`  
* `webhooks/shopify/order/cancel`  

  These endpoints accept a POST request with JSON
  data, as they would be received by a [Shopify
  webhook](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/notifications/webhooks)
  firing.
