# Shopify Webhook
This is a small Django app that listens for incoming webhooks, and then translates those into calls against the Open edX REST APIs.

It provides the following endpoints:

* `webhooks/shopify/order/create`  
* `webhooks/shopify/order/cancel`  

  These endpoints accept a POST request with JSON
  data, as they would be received by a [Shopify
  webhook](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/notifications/webhooks)
  firing.

## Recent Changes

### User Auto-Registration via Shopify Webhook

1. **Feature Description**:
   - When a new order is created via the Shopify webhook, the system now automatically checks if a user with the provided email exists in the database.
   - If the user does not exist, a new user is created with the following details:
     - **Username**: Derived from the email (portion before `@`).
     - **Password**: A default password `passunibooks` is assigned.
   - If the user already exists, no new account is created, and the existing account is used.

2. **Purpose**:
   - This change eliminates the need for manual user registration for customers coming from Shopify.
   - Ensures seamless integration between Shopify and Open edX.

3. **Impact**:
   - Simplifies the user onboarding process.
   - Ensures that users can log in using their email and the default password if they are new.

## Changes in the webhook_user_creation_fix branch

This branch introduces the following updates:

1. Fixed user creation logic:
   - Passwords are now hashed using the `set_password` method.
   - Added handling for duplicate usernames: if a username already exists, a numeric suffix is appended (e.g., `username_1`, `username_2`).

2. Improved Shopify webhook handling for automatic user creation on the OpenEdX side.

These changes address password security issues and prevent username conflicts.
